            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hi, I am Prasad. I am an aspiring frontend developer with a deep passion for creating visually appealing and user-friendly web interfaces. My journey in the world of web development started with a curiosity for how websites are built and a desire to create my own projects from scratch. Over time, I have honed my skills in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I am continually learning and experimenting with new technologies and frameworks to stay updated with industry trends.</p>
            <p>Outside of coding, I have a keen interest in basketball. Playing basketball not only keeps me physically active but also helps me develop teamwork and strategic thinking skills. Additionally, I am an avid follower of the latest technological advancements and new versions of mobile phones. I enjoy exploring the features of new devices and understanding how technology continues to evolve and improve our daily lives.</p>
